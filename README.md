# MaGDAA Library #

The [Mass Gathering Data Acquisition and Analysis][magdaa] project, MaGDAA for short, is a collaboration between the [Flinders University Disaster Research Centre][fudrc] and [The Serval Project][sp] at [Flinders University][fusa] in South Australia.

The focus of the project is on the development of an [Android][android] based platform that can be used to acquire and analyse data at a mass gathering event. For example at a music festival, Schoolies Week, or any other event where a crowd has gathered.

The MaGDAA Library contains utility classes and methods that are used by the other MaGDAA applications. More information about the library is available in the [MaGDAA wiki][wiki].
